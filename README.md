#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing, developing, testing and updating of software systems. Software engineering assists the tech industry via quality and reliability of software systems. It is also importanat to ensure the efficiency and security of software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured programming: prior to the 1960's software was chaotic and had no systematic approach. during the 60's and 70's a new approach was introcued such as modularity. hierachy and clear control structures.
Software development methodologies: new methodologies were introduced between the 80's and 90's to manage software development, making it more flexibile.
DevOps: this milestone focuses on streamlining the collaboration between development and operations teams.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: this is where the projects scope, design,budget etc are defined. plus resource gathering.
feasibility study: the project technicality and feasibility is assesd at this stage.
system design: the system architecture and design are created, this includes user interfaces and system workflows.
coding: the software code is written according to the software programme plan.
testing: the software is now tested to ensure its functionality and reliability.
deployment: the software is now introduced to the user by downloading it and using it, developers at this point ensure that servers run smoothly.
maintenance: the software is now maintained where it is monitored for bugs, updates and performance issues.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two distinct software development methodologies. Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step approach with fixed requirements and extensive documentation, making it suitable for projects with well-defined needs and little change, such as government or regulatory projects. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, allowing for frequent changes and ongoing collaboration with stakeholders, making it ideal for dynamic and complex projects where requirements evolve, like mobile apps or tech startups. While Waterfall is predictable and structured, Agile emphasizes adaptability and continuous feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and testing software applications, ensuring they meet requirements and function correctly. A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer focuses on testing the software to identify bugs and ensure the product's quality through manual or automated testing processes. They work closely with developers to validate that all features work as expected. A Project Manager oversees the project's progress, manages timelines, resources, and risks, and ensures effective communication between team members. They ensure the project aligns with business goals and is delivered on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools in software development. IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm, provide a comprehensive environment with features like code editing, debugging, and syntax highlighting, which streamline development and improve productivity. VCS, like Git (with platforms such as GitHub and GitLab), enables developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and manage code versions, preventing data loss and conflicts. Together, IDEs and VCS enhance code quality, teamwork, and project organization, making software development more efficient and reliable.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers often face challenges such as tight deadlines, debugging complex issues, rapidly changing technologies, and team collaboration difficulties. To overcome these, they can use agile development methodologies to break work into manageable tasks, apply debugging techniques like logging and automated testing to identify issues efficiently, and stay updated with new technologies through continuous learning. Effective communication and collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Jira, Git) help streamline teamwork, while proper time management and prioritization ensure deadlines are met without sacrificing code quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Software testing ensures quality and reliability through different levels of validation. Unit testing verifies individual components or functions in isolation, ensuring they work as expected. Integration testing checks interactions between modules to detect interface issues. System testing evaluates the entire application to confirm it meets functional and non-functional requirements. Acceptance testing is the final stage, where real users or stakeholders validate whether the software meets business needs. Each type plays a crucial role in identifying defects early, reducing errors, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective and precise inputs (prompts) to optimize AI model responses. It involves structuring queries, using context, and refining wording to achieve the desired output. This is crucial when interacting with AI models, as well-designed prompts improve accuracy, relevance, and efficiency. Effective prompt engineering enhances AIâ€™s ability to generate useful insights, automate tasks, and support decision-making in areas like customer support, content creation, and data analysis.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology." 

Improved Prompt: "Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, with examples of its applications."  

The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and concise. It narrows the topic to AI in healthcare, defines the focus (transformation and applications), and guides the AI to provide a detailed and relevant response instead of a broad, unfocused answer.
